# Project Overview

This data analysis project delves into the operational dynamics of a pizza store throughout 2015. By examining various aspects of the store's data, we aim to uncover **significant trends**, **identify areas for improvement**, and offer **data-driven recommendations** to optimize its performance. Ultimately, this project seeks to provide actionable insights that can inform strategic **decision-making** and contribute to the store's **success**.

Insights and recommendations will be provided by answering some key questions, such as:
- How many orders does the store have on average each day?
- Which are the peak hours of the store?
- How many pizzas are typically in an order? 
- Which are the store's top 3 bestselling pizzas?
- Compared to store's bestselling pizzas, which ones are less popular?
- How much revenue did the pizza store make in 2015?
- Can we indentify any seasonality in revenue?

## Data Analysis Process (*SQL Queries*)
> In this section we'll break down the project questions with SQL queries to find some useful insights.
#### -How many orders does the store have on average each day?
```sql
WITH avg_orders AS(
	SELECT DATE(date_time) AS days, COUNT(*) AS total_orders FROM orders
	GROUP BY days)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_orders),0) AS avg_orders_per_day FROM avg_orders;
```
> Pizza store has on average **60 orders per day**

#### -Which are the peak hours of the store?
> *When total orders are: **< 1000 = Not peak hours , [1000, 2000] = Mid peak hours, > 2000 = Peak hours***
```sql
SELECT HOUR(date_time) AS hours, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,
(CASE
	WHEN COUNT(order_id) < 1000 THEN 'Not peak hour'
    WHEN COUNT(order_id)  BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000 THEN 'Mid peak hour'
    WHEN COUNT(order_id) > 2000 THEN 'Peak hour'
END) AS hour_performance FROM orders
GROUP BY hours
ORDER BY hours;
```
> Store's **peak hours** are:<br>
> **1) 12:00 p.m.<br>
> 2) 13:00 p.m.<br>
> 3) 17:00 p.m.<br>
> 4) 18:00 p.m.<br>
> 5) 19:00 p.m.**

#### -How many pizzas are typically in an order? 
```sql
WITH avg_pizzas AS
	(SELECT order_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_pizzas FROM order_details
	GROUP BY order_id)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_pizzas),0) AS pizzas_per_order FROM avg_pizzas;
```
> There are **2 pizzas** on average in every order
#### -Which are the store's top 3 bestselling pizzas?
```sql
SELECT pt.name, SUM(od.quantity) AS total_pizzas FROM pizza_types AS pt
JOIN pizza AS p
ON pt.pizza_type_id = p.pizza_type_id
JOIN order_details AS od
ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
GROUP BY pt.name
ORDER BY total_pizzas DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
> Store's **top 3 bestsellers** are: <br>
> 1) **The Classic Deluxe Pizza** (*with 2453 pizzas sold*)<br>
> 2) **The Barbecue Chicken Pizza** (*with 2432 pizzas sold*)<br>
> 3) **The Hawaiian Pizza** (*with 2422 pizzas sold*)
#### -Compared to store's bestselling pizzas, which ones are less popular?
```sql
SELECT pt.name, SUM(od.quantity) AS total_pizzas FROM pizza_types AS pt
JOIN pizza AS p
ON pt.pizza_type_id = p.pizza_type_id
JOIN order_details AS od
ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
GROUP BY pt.name
ORDER BY total_pizzas;

```
> Store's **less popular** pizzas are:<br>
> 1) **The Brie Carre Pizza** (*with 490 pizzas sold*)
> 2) **The Mediterranean Pizza** (*with 934 pizzas sold*)
> 3) **The Calabrese Pizza** (*with 937 pizzas sold*)
									   
#### -How much revenue did the pizza store make in 2015?
```sql
SELECT YEAR(o.date_time) AS year_2015, ROUND(SUM(p.price * od.quantity),0) AS revenue FROM orders AS o
JOIN order_details AS od
ON o.order_id = od.order_id
JOIN pizza AS p
ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
GROUP BY year_2015;

```
> Store's revenue in 2015 was 817.860
#### -Can we indentify any seasonality in revenue?
```sql
SELECT MONTHNAME(o.date_time) AS months, ROUND(SUM(p.price * od.quantity),0) AS revenue FROM orders AS o
JOIN order_details AS od
ON o.order_id = od.order_id
JOIN pizza AS p
ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
GROUP BY months;

```
