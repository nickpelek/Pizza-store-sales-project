# Project Overview

This data analysis project delves into the operational dynamics of a pizza store throughout 2015. By examining various aspects of the store's data, we aim to uncover **significant trends**, **identify areas for improvement**, and offer **data-driven recommendations** to optimize its performance. Ultimately, this project seeks to provide actionable insights that can inform strategic **decision-making** and contribute to the store's **success**.

Insights and recommendations will be provided by answering some key questions, such as:
- How many orders does the store have on average each day?
- Which are the peak hours of the store?
- How many pizzas are typically in an order? 
- Which are the store's top 3 bestselling pizzas?
- Compared to store's bestselling pizzas, which ones are less popular?
- How much revenue did the pizza store make in 2015?
- Can we indentify any seasonality in revenue?
